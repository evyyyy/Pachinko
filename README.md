# Pachinko
# Description
  This is a team project that we built at school in a group of three. Pachinko is a type of mechanical game originating in Japan and is widely used as a gambling device. In our pachinko game, we tried to spread the idea of protecting the environment and saving natural resources. The balls that the user control represent the limted natural rescoures on Earth. After going through several industrial manifacturing processes, some natural resources could be recycled and some would be wasted. We wish to spread the idea of recycling with the game.
